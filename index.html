        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ajani Adewusi and I am a first year Psychology major with a minor at the University of California Riverside. I intend to have a concentration in Industrial Organization and go to graduate school after I receive my Bachelorâ€™s Degree. I have learned many important workplace skills in college such as how to use microsoft Word, excel spreadsheets, and read finance balance sheets. I have also made many important connections with classmates and professors I have met on campus. UCR has been a very valuable experience for me so far. I have learned so many more skills and gained so much more knowledge that will be useful later on in life. 
<br><br>

        My first job was working for Vans, a shoe and skateboard retail store. I had a seasonal associate job there for roughly four months there.It was top ten in yearly volume compared to all the other Vansâ€™ stores in the company which made it more challenging than most of the other stores. I learned many useful retail skills while working there. I learned how to correctly work a cash register. That included how to correctly add and subtract items from an order, how to process exchange and returns, check if bills were fake or not, and various other skills. Greeting customers was greatly emphasized so i also learned a lot of social skills and how to interact with customers. I was given a daily sales goal every time I went to work which taught me how to efficiently sell products. There were different techniques i learned  such as informing customers about ongoing sales, showing them more expensive alternatives, and making sure to ask them questions about their wants and needs. I think it was overall a very useful experience and taught me a lot of important workplace skills I will be able to apply to my future jobs. Working for Vans helped me grow  in many ways and I believe it has set me up to be able to easily fit in at almost any other retail job. 
<br><br>

        I also gained a lot of useful skills during my time in high school. I learned many basic life skills such as algebra, statistics, and proper english that have been the foundations for my high education in college so far. It also taught me how to be punctual and manage a heavy workload from my large amount of classes that all required vigorous busy work. There were also extracurriculars that have played a big role in my learning. I played three years of varsity football and four years of varsity baseball of which I was a team captain for two. Being involved in these activities taught my leadership, teamwork, and other value skills that would be able to translate well in a workplace. I took a lot of pride in my athletic career and I think it carries over to anything else I choose to put my mind to. I believe I have gained a bunch of valuable skills that will translate well into my career goals.
